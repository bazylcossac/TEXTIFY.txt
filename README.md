# TEXTIFY.txt

TEXTIFY.txt is my first project after LOOOONG break. 
It is project for scrimba

For now the only things you can do are:
 - set username
 - post Textify ( tweet, post whatever )
 - and delete it
   

My plans for this app are:
- add reactions ( likes/hearts, icon is already prepared for that, but only icon hahaah )
- oh i forgot to say that if you want to delete post you have to double click it
- so next i want to add deleting post by clicking on bin icon
- possibility for users to send pictures
- change username, because you can only set it once now

App is automatically adding a time of what your post was published

I hosted it via netlify and i've made a shortcut to my phone screen 
For now only me, my gf and my younger brother are using this app for sending funny messages to each other
